# Chat-Application-Using-java
This project demonstrates a chat application developed in Java, leveraging socket programming for communication between two programs over a network. It addresses the classic producer-consumer problem using multithreading concepts to manage concurrent sending and receiving of messages.
# Key Concepts Covered:
 Socket Programming: Utilizing Java's built-in classes to establish connections and facilitate data transfer between client and server.
Multithreading: Implementing multiple threads, including the main thread, to achieve simultaneous execution of tasks such as sending and receiving data.
Networking: Setting up communication channels between client and server applications.
GUI Development with Swing: Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a user-friendly chat interface.
# Features:
Console-Based and GUI-Based Modes: Supports both command-line interface (CLI) interaction and a graphical user interface for intuitive user experience.
Message Queuing: Implements queue mechanisms to manage message handling between sender and receiver threads.
Data Handling: Efficient reading and writing of data streams using BufferedReader and PrintWriter for effective communication.
# Usage:
Console Mode: Run the application from the command line interface.
GUI Mode: Launch the GUI for an interactive chat experience.
Getting Started:
Clone the repository.
Compile and run the server and client applications on separate terminals or instances.
Choose between CLI or GUI mode based on preference.
